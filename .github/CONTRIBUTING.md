Feel free to contribute to MyBot.
There is mainly three ways to contribute :
 1.  Source code contributions
 2.  Translations contributions
 3.  Financial contributions

## Source code contributions

If you have any suggestion for the bot, and you think you have the ability to do it yourself, start by contacting me through Discord!
It would be a pleasure to count you from the Mybot's contibutors!
Then, fork this project, make the changes you want, and open a Pull Request on `master`.
Before open a Pull Request, you can start by running `tox`. This will ensure your code respect the style, etc...

## Translations contributions

MyBot is a multi-language bot! The codebase is in english, which is then translated in several languages.

Currently, MyBot is translated in :
  -  French

If you know one of these languages, you can contribute to translations here:

If you are able to add a new language to the bot, please contact me on Discord! It would be a pleasure to add a new language to MyBot!
However, this language must also be available on the Discord application.
